## Motivation

This repository holds a blog with a filtering functionality.

[`https://blogo-opal.vercel.app/`](https://blogo-opal.vercel.app/).

In this project, I created a simple next.js app that consumes some filler data and displays it such that you can filter your prefered posts.

You can run it by cloning the repository. Running `cd blogo`, `yarn` then executing the command `yarn dev`.

You will be able to access the server on localhost:3000 by default.

## Requirements

Typescript, Tailwind Css, Next.js and more.
